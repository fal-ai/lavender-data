One of Lavender Data's powerful features is the ability to pause and resume iterations.
Here's how to resume an iteration.

### Save the Iteration ID

You need to save the iteration id to resume it later.

```python
dataloader = LavenderDataLoader(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
)
print(dataloader.id)
```

### Put back the Samples In Progress

Before resuming the iteration, you might want to put back
the samples still in progress. For example, they can still in preprocessing,
or they are prefetched but not used yet.
You can put back them into the iteration queue by calling `pushback` method, 
or through the web UI.

<Tabs syncKey="ui-or-py">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
lavender-data client iterations pushback it-...
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
dataloader.pushback()
# or
lavender.pushback(dataloader.id)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="web-ui" label="Web UI">

Click the "Pushback" button in the iteration detail page.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Resume an Iteration

Later, you can resume the iteration from where it left off:

```python
for batch in LavenderDataLoader(iteration_id="it-..."):
    # Continue processing from where you left off
    process_batch(batch)
```
