For context parallelism, you can set the `replication_pg` parameter.
It is a list of list of integers, where each inner list is a partition of the ranks.
For example, `[[0, 1], [2, 3]]` means that rank 0 and 1 are in the first partition,
and rank 2 and 3 are in the second partition. 
Within each partition, the ranks get the same samples.

```python
dataloader = LavenderDataLoader(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    rank=os.environ["RANK"],
    replication_pg=[[0, 1], [2, 3]],
)
```
