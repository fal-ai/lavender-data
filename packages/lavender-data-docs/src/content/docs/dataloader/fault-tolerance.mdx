Lavender Data is designed to handle failures gracefully, ensuring your training pipeline remains robust.

### Handling Failed Samples

By default, Lavender Data will skip failed samples. 
You can control this behavior with the `stop_on_failure` and `max_retry_count` parameters.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `stop_on_failure` | Stop the iteration if a sample fails, instead of skipping it | `False` |
| `max_retry_count` | Retry each failed sample up to this number of times | `0` |


```python
dataloader = LavenderDataLoader(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    stop_on_failure=True, # Stop the iteration if a sample fails
    max_retry_count=3, # Retry each failed sample up to 3 times
)
```
