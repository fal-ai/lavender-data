Lavender Data is designed to handle failures gracefully, ensuring your training pipeline remains robust.

### Handling Failed Samples

By default, Lavender Data will skip failed samples. 
You can control this behavior with the `skip_on_failure` and `max_retry_count` parameters.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `skip_on_failure` | Skip the sample if it fails (after max_retry_count attempts), instead of stopping the iteration | `False` |
| `max_retry_count` | Retry each failed sample up to this number of times | `0` |


```python
dataloader = LavenderDataLoader(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    skip_on_failure=True, # Skip the sample if it fails (after max_retry_count attempts)
    max_retry_count=3, # Retry each failed sample up to 3 times
)
```
