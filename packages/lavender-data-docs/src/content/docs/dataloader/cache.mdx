Lavender Data caches yielded samples/batches to avoid redundant processing.
Please refer to the [Cache](/concepts/cache) page for more details.

### Ignoring Cache

You can ignore caches and reprocess the data by setting the `no_cache` parameter to `True` on creating the iteration instance.

```python
dataloader = LavenderDataLoader(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    no_cache=True,
)
```
