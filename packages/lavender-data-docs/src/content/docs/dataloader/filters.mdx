Filters determine which samples to include or exclude during iteration.

```python
dataloader = LavenderDataLoader(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    filters=[("uid_mod", {"mod": 2})],  # To give a parameter to the module, use a tuple (name, params)
    batch_size=10,
)
```
