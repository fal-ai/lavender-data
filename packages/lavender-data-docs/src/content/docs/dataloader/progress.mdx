You can check the progress of the data loader, including how many samples are processed and left.

The progress object has the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Total | The total number of samples to process in the iteration. |
| Current | The latest index of the sample that is being processed. |
| Inprogress | The samples that are being processed.<br/>Includes the index of the sample, the timestamp when it started,<br/>and the rank of the worker that is processing it. |
| Completed | The number of samples that have been completed. |
| Filtered | The number of samples that have been filtered out. |
| Failed | The number of samples that have failed to process. |
