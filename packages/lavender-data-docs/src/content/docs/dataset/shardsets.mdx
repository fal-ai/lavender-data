A **Shardset** represents a collection of related columns (features) stored as **Shards** (files).


### Directory Structure

Each shardset can be considered as a directory containing multiple shard files.
The directory should be flat, containing the shard files only.
If the order matters, sort shards by the filename.

<FileTree>
- /shardset_1/
  - shard.00000.csv
  - shard.00001.csv
  - ...
- /shardset_2/
  - shard.00000.csv
  - shard.00001.csv
  - ...
</FileTree>



### File Format

Shard files should be in tabular formats.
Currently, Lavender Data supports CSV and Parquet formats.

Each shard file should have the same schema within the same shardset.

```
# /path/to/the/shardset/shard.00000.csv
uid,image_url,caption
0,https://example.com/image-00000.jpg,Caption for image 00000
1,https://example.com/image-00001.jpg,Caption for image 00001
2,https://example.com/image-00002.jpg,Caption for image 00002
3,https://example.com/image-00003.jpg,Caption for image 00003
4,https://example.com/image-00004.jpg,Caption for image 00004
5,https://example.com/image-00005.jpg,Caption for image 00005
6,https://example.com/image-00006.jpg,Caption for image 00006
7,https://example.com/image-00007.jpg,Caption for image 00007
8,https://example.com/image-00008.jpg,Caption for image 00008
9,https://example.com/image-00009.jpg,Caption for image 00009
```

### Location

The directory can be located on a file system or a cloud storage.
The `location` field of the shardset is used to identify the location of a shardset.

```python
# file system
shardset.location = "file:///path/to/the/shardset"

# s3
shardset.location = "s3://my-bucket/path/to/the/shardset"
```
