Lavender Data provides several features for iterating over datasets,
giving you fine-grained control over how data is processed.

## Shuffling Data

Shuffling is essential for many ML training scenarios.
Lavender Data provides powerful options for shuffling your data across shards.

### Basic Shuffling

Set `shuffle=True` to shuffle the data.

```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    shuffle=True,
)
```

### Controlling Randomness

To ensure reproducibility, you can set a seed for the shuffle.

```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    shuffle=True,
    shuffle_seed=42,  # Fixed seed for reproducibility
)
```

### Block Size Control

The `shuffle_block_size` parameter controls how many shards are shuffled at once.
Larger values provide better randomness but use more memory:

```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    shuffle=True,
    shuffle_seed=42,
    shuffle_block_size=3,  # Shuffle 3 shards at a time
)
```

## Cache

Lavender Data caches yielded samples/batches to avoid redundant processing.
Please refer to the [Cache](/concepts/cache) page for more details.

### Ignoring Cache

You can ignore caches and reprocess the data by setting the `no_cache` parameter to `True` on creating the iteration instance.

```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    no_cache=True,
)
```

## Fault Tolerance

Lavender Data is designed to handle failures gracefully, ensuring your training pipeline remains robust.

### Handling Failed Samples

By default, Lavender Data will skip failed samples. 
You can control this behavior with the `stop_on_failure` and `max_retry_count` parameters.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `stop_on_failure` | Stop the iteration if a sample fails, instead of skipping it | `False` |
| `max_retry_count` | Retry each failed sample up to this number of times | `0` |


```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    stop_on_failure=True, # Stop the iteration if a sample fails
    max_retry_count=3, # Retry each failed sample up to 3 times
)
```


## Resumable Iterations

One of Lavender Data's powerful features is the ability to pause and resume iterations:

### Saving the Iteration ID

You need to save the iteration id to resume it later.

```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
)
print(iteration.id)
```

### Putting back the Samples In Progress

Before resuming the iteration, you might want to put back
the samples still in progress. For example, they can still in preprocessing,
or they are prefetched but not used yet.
You can put back them into the iteration queue by calling `pushback` method, 
or through the web UI.

<Tabs syncKey="ui-or-py">
  <TabItem value="web-ui" label="Web UI">

Click the "Pushback" button in the iteration detail page.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
iteration.pushback()
# or
lavender.pushback(iteration.id)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Resuming an Iteration

Later, you can resume the iteration from where it left off:

```python
for batch in Iteration.from_iteration_id("it-..."):
    # Continue processing from where you left off
    process_batch(batch)
```

## Replication PG

For context parallelism, you can set the `replication_pg` parameter.
It is a list of list of integers, where each inner list is a partition of the ranks.
For example, `[[0, 1], [2, 3]]` means that rank 0 and 1 are in the first partition,
and rank 2 and 3 are in the second partition. 
Within each partition, the ranks get the same samples.

```python
iteration = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    replication_pg=[[0, 1], [2, 3]],
)
```


## PyTorch Integration

Convert your iteration to a PyTorch DataLoader for seamless integration with PyTorch, 
by calling the `to_torch_dataloader` method.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `prefetch_factor` | Number of batches to prefetch. | `None` |
| `pin_memory` | Pin memory for faster GPU transfer. | `False` |
| `pin_memory_device` | Device to pin memory to. | `""` |
| `in_order` | Whether to iterate in order. <br />If `False`, the order is not guaranteed but can be slightly faster. | `True` |
| `poll_interval` | How often to check for new samples. <br />Smaller values can make the iteration faster<br />but can lead to more cpu usage on the server side. | `0.01` |


```python
dataloader = Iteration.from_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset.id,
    shardsets=[shardset.id],
    batch_size=10,
    shuffle=True,
).to_torch_dataloader(
    prefetch_factor=4,
    pin_memory=True,
    pin_memory_device="cuda:0",
    in_order=True,
)

for batch in dataloader:
    # Use in PyTorch training loop
    outputs = model(batch)
    loss = criterion(outputs, batch["labels"])
    # ...
```
