Lavender Data is a data pipeline framework
built by [fal.ai](https://fal.ai).

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Remote Preprocessing" icon="star">
    - Preprocess data on a remote server and offload your training GPUs
    - Load data directly into memory through a network without any disk usage
    - Support cloud storages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Joinable Dataset" icon="random">
    - Add new features to your dataset without rewriting your data
    - Selectively load only the features you need for your task
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Data Loading" icon="rocket">
    - Filter rows or columns on the fly
    - Resume an iteration from where you left off
    - Retry or skip failed samples to make it fault tolerant
    - Shuffle data across shards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web UI" icon="laptop">
    - Define and preview your datasets
    - Track the realtime progress of your iterations
  </Card>
</CardGrid>


## Why Lavender Data?

Traditional ML data pipelines often face several challenges:

1. **GPU Memory Overhead**: Preprocessing on the same GPU used for training
2. **Disk Space Limitations**: Having to store entire datasets on disk
3. **Inflexible Data Management**: Difficulty in adding new features or columns
4. **Poor Fault Tolerance**: Failing when a single sample errors out

Lavender Data solves these problems by providing a flexible, efficient, and robust solution for ML data management and preprocessing.
