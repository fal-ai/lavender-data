Lavender Data organizes your data in a hierarchical structure:

![Dataset Layers](/dataset-layers.png)

- **Dataset**: The top-level container for your data, identified by a unique name
- **Shardset**: A collection of data shards within a dataset, typically representing a group of related columns
- **Shard**: A single file that contains a subset of the data

This layered approach allows for efficient data management and feature addition without duplicating the entire dataset.
