The server is responsible for:

<Steps>
1. Manage datasets & shardsets metadata
2. Manage iterations, determine which samples to load
3. Preprocess and cache data
4. Serve preprocessed data to trainer nodes
</Steps>

You can manage the server daemon with `lavender-data server start, stop, restart, logs` command.

```bash
lavender-data server start --init
```

```
lavender-data is running on 0.0.0.0:8000
UI is running on http://localhost:3000
API key created: la-...
```

```bash
# Stop the server
lavender-data server stop
```

```bash
# Restart the server
lavender-data server restart
```

```bash
# Show logs from the server
lavender-data server logs
```

Alternatively, you can start the server in foreground with `lavender-data server run` command.
