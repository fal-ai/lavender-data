### Dataset Server

You might need to preprocess your data on the training nodes which takes a lot of time and resources.

Lavender data introduces a client-server architecture to offload data preprocessing from your training pipeline.

The server is responsible for:

<Steps>
1. Manage datasets & shardsets metadata
2. Manage iterations, determine which samples to load
3. Preprocess and cache data
4. Serve preprocessed data to trainer nodes
</Steps>

### Shardset

Normally, a dataset is a single file containing all the data, or multiple files (a.k.a. shards) with the same schema.

This might be problematic when you want to add a new feature, or you don't want to load a certain large column.

<Steps>
1. **I just want to add this tiny feature**
   
   What if you want to add a 10MB column but the parquet files are 100GB?

2. **I don't need that column**
   
   What if you don't need to load `caption_embeddings` and it consumes 99% of the file size?
</Steps>


Lavender data introduces a `shardset` layer to solve this problem.
A Shardset represents a collection of related columns (features) stored as Shards (files).

<Steps>
1. **I just want to add this tiny feature**
   
   Add a new shardset!

2. **I don't need that column**
   
   Use only desired shardsets during the training!
</Steps>
